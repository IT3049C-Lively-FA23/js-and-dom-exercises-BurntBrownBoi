## Self-Evaluation: 
(You may base this on the number of exercises you were able to complete)
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 

Less than 20 for being late as hell but to be fair, I was having issues with my windows install that I initally thought went away but came back and messed everything up. I'll be catching up on assignments faster that you can say Peter Griffin

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- What did you learn that you found interesting -->
The arr.reduce function was new to me and I actually implemented it in my roblox shooter game for some array I was stuck on. I just translated it to Lua so it helped lol

### How long it took you to finish this?
about an hour or two
